# Smart-package-storage-and-pickup
Final year graduation project, our project attempts to solve a traditional courier package storage &amp; retrieve issue. Agentâ€™s store the package randomly in the racks and lookup every rack when the customer arrives for pickup. Our system will automate this task by keeping the record of every package storage location during the barcode scan when the package arrives at the facility for the first time. When the customer arrives, it will show the exact rack location of the package to the agent. The system can reduce the drive through pickup time up to 70%, which can be almost 3-5 minutes per package.
